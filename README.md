## EKS Developers Workshop

The EKS Developers Workshop is a technical workshop designed to equip developers with the skills needed to transition into the Kubernetes and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) ecosystems. It is ideal for those with a foundational understanding of container technologies and a desire to apply this knowledge to Kubernetes-based application deployments, especially within the AWS ecosystem.
