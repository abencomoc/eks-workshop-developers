# Welcome to the EKS Developers Workshop
Transitioning to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) represents a significant shift in application deployment and management. This workshop is tailored to streamline that transition, focusing on refactoring applications for containerized and Kubernetes environments.

## Introduction
Targeted at developers new to Kubernetes, this workshop introduces you to building multi-architecture container images suitable for Kubernetes, coupled with strategies to optimize resources and reduce expenses. Grounded in The Twelve-Factor App methodology, we don't just explain the principlesâ€”we embed them into the fabric of our hands-on lab exercises. Through the lens of stateful and stateless microservices, we offer an end-to-end learning experience, using a specially designed application and database as teaching tools. Starting with local deployments via Minikube, you'll build a solid understanding that prepares you for the complexities of Amazon EKS.

The course then moves to EKS, highlighting the integration of AWS open-source projects. You'll learn to utilize essential services like AWS Open Telemetry for request tracing, AWS Secrets Manager for secure information storage, and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL for database management. This practical comparison of managed and self-managed databases equips you with the knowledge to choose the right architecture for your needs.

By the end of this workshop, you'll have a robust set of skills to deploy and manage Kubernetes workloads on AWS with confidence. Get ready to take control of your EKS journey. Welcome aboard!
