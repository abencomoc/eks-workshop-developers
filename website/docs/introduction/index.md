# Welcome to the EKS Developers Workshop
Welcome to the EKS Developers Workshop, a technical deep-dive into refactoring applications for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). 
## Who Should Attend?
This workshop is designed for developers looking to expand their expertise into Kubernetes and EKS. It's particularly beneficial for those who have: 
* A foundational understanding of container technologies and seek to increase their knowledge of Kubernetes-based application deployments.
* Aim to transition traditional applications to cloud-native architectures, particularly within the AWS ecosystem.
## What You Will Learn
* **Application Refactoring:** Apply The Twelve-Factor App methodology in refactoring Python applications for optimized containerization.
* **Containerization Techniques:** Master the creation and management of Docker containers, integrate Amazon ECR with Docker Compose, and handle multi-architecture containers.
* **Kubernetes Deployment:** Execute the deployment of FastAPI and PostgreSQL microservices using minikube. Learn to manage Kubernetes resources effectively, including securing microservices with Kubernetes secrets.
* **Amazon EKS Utilization:** Build your skills in microservice deployments, and integrations with AWS services like AWS Secrets Manager and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. 
## Key Learning Outcomes
* Refactor and containerize applications for Kubernetes and EKS.
* Build and manage Docker containers, including multi-architecture variants.
* Deploy and secure microservices in Kubernetes and EKS environments.
* Leverage AWS services and tools for optimized Kubernetes management.
## Getting Started
Dive into our [overview](./python/about-workshop.md) to commence your technical exploration of EKS. Equip yourself with the knowledge and skills to confidently manage Kubernetes applications on AWS.
