# Welcome to the EKS Developers Workshop
Welcome to the EKS Developers Workshop, a technical deep-dive into refactoring applications for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). 

## Who Is This Workshop For?
This workshop is tailored for developers that want to refactor an application for containers and Kubernetes environments using EKS. It's specifically designed to be Kubernetes beginner-friendly and particularly beneficial for those who: 

* Need visibility of the entire Kubernetes lifecycle from refactoring, containers, to Kubernetes integrations on Amazon EKS.
* Have a foundational understanding of container technologies and seek to increase their knowledge of Kubernetes-based application deployments.
* Aim to transition traditional applications to cloud-native architectures, particularly within the AWS ecosystem.

## What You Will Learn
* **Application Refactoring:** Learn how to apply The Twelve-Factor App methodologies to refactor applications for containers and Kubernetes.

* **Containerization Techniques:** Master the creation and management of Docker containers, integrate Amazon ECR with Docker Compose, and handle multi-architecture containers.
* **Kubernetes Deployment:** Learn how to deploy your application as microservices in a local minikube cluster, including securing microservices with Kubernetes secrets.
* **Amazon EKS Deployment:** Build your skills in microservice deployments in production on Amazon EKS, integrating with AWS services like AWS Secrets Manager and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. 

## Key Learning Outcomes
* Refactor and containerize applications for Kubernetes and EKS.
* Build and manage Docker containers, including multi-architecture variants.
* Deploy and secure microservices in Kubernetes and EKS environments.
* Leverage AWS services and tools for optimized Kubernetes management.

## Getting Started
Dive into our [overview](./python/about-workshop.md) to commence your technical exploration of EKS. Equip yourself with the knowledge and skills to confidently manage Kubernetes applications on AWS.
