title: Accessing the FastAPI App

## Objective
This guide aims to guide you through the process of accessing your microservices deployed onto a minikube cluster. By using minikube's 'port forwarding' feature and enabling a network tunnel, we'll expose the FastAPI service, allowing you to interact with it from your local machine's web browser. This process is especially crucial for LoadBalancer service types, as they require an additional network route from the host to the service's cluster.

## 1. Checking the Status of Pods
Before we try to access our application, we need to ensure that all of our pods are running correctly. To check the status of all pods, run the following command:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n my-cool-app
```
All your pods should be in the "Running" state. If they're not, you will need to troubleshoot the deployment before proceeding.

## 2. Enabling Minikube Tunnel
Given that the service type for our FastAPI application is a 'LoadBalancer', we need to enable a minikube tunnel to access the service from our host machine.

In a new terminal window, run the following command:
```bash
minikube tunnel
```
This command needs to be continuously running to keep the network route open, so make sure to leave this terminal window open.

## 3. Accessing the FastAPI Service
Now that the tunnel has been established, we can access the FastAPI service using the [minikube service](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/commands/service/) command. Run the following command in a separate terminal window:
```bash
minikube service fastapi-service --namespace=my-cool-app
```
The expected output should look like this:
```bash
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------|
|  NAMESPACE  |      NAME       | TARGET PORT |            URL            |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| my-cool-app | fastapi-service |          80 | http://192.168.49.2:30639 |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------|
üèÉ  Starting tunnel for service fastapi-service.
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|
|  NAMESPACE  |      NAME       | TARGET PORT |          URL           |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| my-cool-app | fastapi-service |             | http://127.0.0.1:58665 |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|
üéâ  Opening service my-cool-app/fastapi-service in default browser...
‚ùó  Because you are using a Docker driver on darwin, the terminal needs to be open to run it.
```

## 4. Verifying the Setup by Adding a Book
To confirm that everything is functioning as expected, attempt to add a book by selecting the **Create a book** option.

## Conclusion
This guide has walked you through the steps necessary to access your microservices, specifically the FastAPI service, deployed on a minikube cluster from your local machine. We've shown how to check the status of your pods, enable a minikube tunnel for access, and verify your setup by interacting with the FastAPI service. The minikube service command is a convenient way to expose your Kubernetes services to your local machine and interact with them as if they were locally deployed.
